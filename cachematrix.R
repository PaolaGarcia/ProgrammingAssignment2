## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## This program is based in two functions in where you can
## create a matrix and store it in cache. Then solve
## the matrix to get the inverse. If the result is already
## stored in cache, solving the matrix would not be necessary. 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can save ub cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated, the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
